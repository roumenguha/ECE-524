    "# 3. Heat-Pipe Design [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "A heated fluid at temperature $T$ (degrees above ambient temperature) flows in a pipe with fixed length and circular cross section with radius $r$. A layer of insulation, with thickness $w$, surrounds the pipe to reduce heat loss through the pipe walls ($w$ is much smaller than $r$). The design variables in this problem are $T$, $r$, and $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy cost due to heat loss is roughly equal to $α_1Tr/w$. The cost of the pipe, which has a fixed wall thickness, is approximately proportional to the total material, i.e., it is given by $α_2r$. The cost of the insulation is also approximately proportional to the total insulation material, i.e., roughly $α_3rw$. The total cost is the sum of these three costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat flow down the pipe is entirely due to the flow of the fluid, which has a fixed velocity, i.e., it is given by $α_4Tr^2$. The constants $α_i$ with $i ∈ \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ are __all positive__, as are the variables $T$, $r$, and $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the problem: maximize the total heat flow down the pipe, subject to an upper limit $C_{max}$ on total cost, and the constraints\n",

    "__b)__ Consider a simple instance of this problem, where $C_{max} = 500$ and $α_1 = α_2 = α_3 = α_4 = 1$. Also assume for simplicity that __each variable has a lower bound of zero__ and __no upper bound__. Solve this problem using JuMP. Use the Mosek solver and the command __@NLconstraint(...)__ to specify nonlinear constraints such as log-sum-exp functions. Note: Mosek can solve general convex optimization problems!
