    "A site is being investigated as a potential location for a new museum. An aerial plan of the site is shown in the figure below (in __feet__). The museum will have a __circular__ footprint and law mandates that there be __at least 50 feet of clearance between the building and any road__. If we want the largest possible museum, where should it be located? What is its optimal radius? Re-plot the figure below along with the optimally designed museum."
