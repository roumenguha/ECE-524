    "# 1. Stigler's Diet [10 pts]\n",
    "#### by Roumen Guha, on Sunday, February 12th, 2017\n",
    "True story! In 1945, American economist (and future Nobel laureate) George Stigler published a paper investigating the composition of an optimal diet; minimizing total cost while meeting the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of several nutrients. To answer this question, Stigler tabulated a list of 77 foods and their nutrient content for 9 nutrients: calories, protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and ascorbic acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make calculations easier, Stigler normalized his data so each row shows the nutrients contained in \\$1’s worth of the given food item. Back then, \\$1 could buy you quite a lot! When Stigler posed his diet problem, the simplex method had not yet been invented. In his paper, he wrote: “... the procedure is experimental because there does not appear to be any direct method\n",
    "of finding the minimum of a linear function subject to linear conditions.” Nevertheless, through a combination of “trial and error, mathematical insight, and agility”, he eventually arrived at a solution: a diet costing only $39.93 per year. Though he confessed: “There is no reason to believe that the cheapest combination was found, for only a handful of the [many] possible combinations of commodities were examined.”\n",
    "\n",
    "__(a)__ Formulate Stigler’s diet problem as an LP and solve it. To get you started, Stigler’s original data is provided in stigler.csv, and the IJulia notebook stigler.ipynb imports the data and puts it into a convenient array format. How does your cheapest diet compare in annual cost to Stigler’s? What foods make up your optimal diet?"
