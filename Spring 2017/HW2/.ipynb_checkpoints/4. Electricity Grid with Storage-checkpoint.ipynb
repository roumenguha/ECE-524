    "# 4. Electricity Grid with Storage [15 pts]\n",
    "#### by Roumen Guha, on Sunday, February 12th, 2017\n",

    "The town of Hamilton buys its electricity from the Powerco utility, which charges for electricity on an hourly basis. If less than 50 MWh is used during a given hour, then the cost is \\$100 per MWh. Any excess beyond 50 MWh used during the hour is charged at the higher rate of \\$400 per MWh. The maximum power that Powerco can provide in any given hour is 75 MWh. Here is what the average daily electricity demand looks like for Hamilton during the month of January:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Hour of Day (AM) | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n",
    "|------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n",
    "| Demand (MWh)     | 43 | 40 | 36 | 36 | 35 | 38 | 41 | 46 | 49 | 48 | 47 | 47 |\n",

    "\n",
    "The mayor of Hamilton is concerned because the high electricity use during evening hours is costing the city a lot of money. There is also risk of black-outs at around 7pm because the average demand is dangerously close to Powerco’s 75 MWh limit.\n",
    "To address these issues, the mayor purchased a large battery with a storage capacity of 30 MWh. The idea is that extra electricity could be purchased early in the day (at the lower rate), stored in the battery, and used later in the day when demand (and prices) are high."
