    "# 1. Hexagon construction [10 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to figure out the optimal geometry of a hexagon such that (1) the __hexagon's area is maximized__ and (2) the hexagon's __diameter does not exceed 1__. The diameter of the hexagon is the largest distance between any pair of points belonging to the hexagon. There are many different ways to solve this problem. A few suggestions/hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Place one of the vertices at the origin so that you don't need as many decision variables.\n",
    "+ A simple way of computing the area of a hexagon is to split it into four triangles that share a common vertex. The area of the hexagon is then the sum of the areas of the four triangles.\n",
    "+ The optimal solution will look like a legitimate hexagon. It will not be degenerate (no coincident vertices), nor will it be perfectly regular (all sidelengths equal).\n",

    "Plot a picture of the optimal hexagon."
